# Course Overview  

## How are Languages Implemented  

1. Intepreters - Intepreters run programs "as is"  
2. Compilers - Compilers fo extensive prepocessing  

## The structure of a Compiler  

1. Lexical Analysis  
2. Parsing  
3. Semantic Analysis  
4. Optimization  
5. Code Generation  

- **Lexical analyser** divides programs into "words" or "tokens".  
- **Parsing**: Once words are understood, the next step is to understand the sentence structure.  
- **Semantic analysis**: Once the structure is understood, we can try to understand the meaning.  
- **Optimization** : Automatically modify programs so that they run faster, use less memory and conserve more resources.  
- **Code generation** - A translation into another language.
